## Description

You can send emails with file attachments using C# and FluentEmail. In this tutorial, I show you how to do that. Specifically, we wrote C# code to do the following:  
1. Send plain text emails using SMTP and your free Gmail account. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer protocol 
2. Send HTML emails with images and buttons using SMTP and your free Gmail account. 
3. Send HTML emails with the PDF file attachment using the same SMTP and your free Gmail account for sent emails. 
4. Send HTML emails with images and buttons using a transactional email provider API. 
5. Send HTML emails with a PDF file attachment using a transactional email provider API and 
6. Send a newsletter or bulk HTML emails with images using a transactional email provider. 

> This tutorial covers almost all the common email sending scenarios. You can just copy and reuse in your .NET applications.
